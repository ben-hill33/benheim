## Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions return a single value based on a collection of rows.

These functions are built in to SQL. Refer to the table below:

| Function 	|              Meaning              	|
|:--------:	|:---------------------------------:	|
| AVG()    	| Average of the values in a column 	|
| COUNT()  	| Count of the number of rows       	|
| MAX()    	| Highest value in a column         	|
| STD()    	| Lowest value in a column          	|
| SUM()    	| Standard deviation                	|
| VAR()    	| Variance                          	|

The `WHERE` clause can be used to limit the recoreds returned with aggregate functions just like regular SELECT statements.

You can us e the `GROUP BY` to return groups based on fields rather than all the records.

You can use `JOINS` as well.
