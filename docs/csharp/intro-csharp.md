A Namespace provides a way to group similar classes and can be used to avoid naming conflicts in large projects.

C# methods have two parts:

- **Method header**: Includes the method name and information about what will pass into and be returned from a method. 
- **Method body**: Is contained within a pair of curly brackets and includes instructions executed by the method.

Every application _must_ have a `Main()` method. This method returns nothing, or _void_.

## Compiling

C# code can be ran by making use of what's called [**Just-In-Time** (JIT) **compilation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation){:target="blank"}, which is a way of executing computer code that involves compilation _during_ the execution of a program (at run time) rather than before execution.
