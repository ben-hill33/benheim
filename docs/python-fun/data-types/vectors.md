## Intro to Vectors

Many real-world phenomena involve both a _magnitude_ and a _direction_. 

- Wind moves a sailboat based on the speed and direction of the wind. 
- In billiards, a cue ball moves according to the speed of the cue stick on impact and the stick's direction. 
- A space shuttle's thrusters move the shuttle based on the magnitude of the thrust and the thrusters' direction. 

**Quantities that involve both magnitude and direction are called vectors, represented by an arrow**.

- Vectors are also used in fields outside of physics. 
- In machine learning, feature vectors are used to store information about the related numeric properties of individuals in a population, such as a set of people's height (inches), weight (in pounds), blood pressure scores, and resting pulse (beats per minute).

    - _vector:_ a mathematical object with magnitude and direction, represented by an arrow. 
      - The point at which a vector starts is called the _initial point_
      - The point at which a vector ends is called _terminal points_
    - _vector notation:_ The most common notation for a vector is a lowercase boldfaced letter such as **u** or as a directed line segment as **AB** with a drawn arrow over the top of both letters. 
    - The _magnitude_ of a vector, denoted by ||v||, is the length of the vector
