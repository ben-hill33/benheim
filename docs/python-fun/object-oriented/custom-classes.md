Class customization is the process of defining how a class should behave for some common operations. Such operations might include:

- printing
- accessing attributes
- how instance objects are to compared to each other

## Memory allocation

The process of an application requesting and being granted memory is known as **memory allocation**.

Memory used by a Python application must be granted by the operating system. When an application requests specific amount of memory, the operating system can then choose to grant or deny the request. 

Some programming languages require the programmer to write memory allocation code; the Python runtime handles memory allocation _for_ the programmer. This saves a programmer time by not having to write out the code.
