## [In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932)

In TDD, your entire approach to writing a program will be in baby steps, making each test you write, making it pass, and then refactoring from there for better efficiency.
- The greatest advantage of TDD is to craft the **software design first**
- Your code will be more reliable: after a change you can run your tests
### Vocab
- Unit tests
  - are some pieces of code to exercise the input, output, and behavior of your code. 
- TDD
  - Test driven development is a strategy to think and write using tests first
- AAA
  - **Arrange:**
    - Organize the data needed to execute that piece of code(input)
  - **Act:**
    - execute the code being tested (exercise the behavior)
  - **Assert:**
    - after code execution, check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting
- The Cycle
  - is made up by three steps:
    - Write a unit test and make it fail. It needs to fail because the feature hasn't been written yet and you need to verify it fails
    - Write the feature and make the test pass
    - Refactor the code
